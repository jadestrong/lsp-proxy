#+title: LSP-COPILOT

* Introducation
Lsp-Copilot is an LSP (Language Server Protocol) client for Emacs, implemented in Rust and inspired by [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge][lsp-bridge]]. It uses ~jsonrpc.el~ to facilitate communication between Emacs and the Lsp-Copilot Server. The Lsp-Copilot Server acts as an intermediary between Emacs and various language servers, handling communication with the language servers, processing the responses, and returning them to Emacs.

The features it supports are:
- find definitions/references/implementatoins/type-definition/declaration (as a xref backend)
- completion (as a capf function) support snippet and auto import, reuse requests that are already being processed, while caching the results to improve response speed, before returning all the completion candidates, the server will do fuzzy matching and filter out entries with no match.
- diagnostics (as a flycheck backend) process diagnostics when idle.
- hover (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-describe-thing-at-point~)
- code action (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-execute-code-action~)
- rename (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-rename~)
- format buffer (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-format-buffer~)
- workspace command, such as ~typescript.restartTsServer(vtsls)~ 、 ~reloadWorkspace(rust-analyzer)~ (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-execute-command~)
- signature/inlay hints (triggered by ~lsp-copilot-signature-mode~ 、 ~lsp-copilot-inlay-hints-mode~), there might be bugs and usability issues, as it is used relatively infrequently.

* Add a new language
Performed simple tests on Windows 11 and Arch Linux, it works properly. I have tested it on macOS and use it for daily development in JavaScript, Rust, etc. Therefore, tools like vtsls, typescript-language-server, eslint, tailwindcss, css, and others work fine
- JavaScript/Typescript: [[https://github.com/yioneko/vtsls][vtsls]] (built-in)、[[https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server][typescript-language-server]]
- eslint、html、css、html: [[https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted][vscode-langservers-extracted]]
- tailwindcss: [[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/language-server][@tailwindcss/language-server]]

The configuration for a new language can refer to the [[https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml][Helix configuration]]. Supported fields are based on [[https://github.com/jadestrong/lsp-copilot/blob/main/languages.toml][the built-in configuration file]], and only LSP-related fields are supported.
Open custom language config file by ~lsp-copilot-open-config-file~ and add your config, then execute ~lsp-copilot-restart~.

The configuration fields for adding language support are: ~name、roots、language-id、file-types、language-servers~ . Other fields in the Helix configuration are not supported.

* Acknowledgements
Thanks to [[https://github.com/helix-editor/helix][Helix]], the architecture of Lsp-Copilot Server is entirely based on Helix's implementation. Language configuration and communication with different language servers are all dependent on Helix. As a Rust beginner, I've gained a lot from this approach during the implementation.

Regarding the communication between Emacs and Lsp-Copilot, I would like to especially thank [[https://github.com/copilot-emacs/copilot.el][copilot.el]] and [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer][rust-analyzer]]. The usage of jsonrpc.el was learned from copilot.el, while the approach to receiving and handling Emacs requests was inspired by the implementation in rust-analyzer.

The various methods used to implement LSP-related functionality on the Emacs side were learned from [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] and [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot][eglot]]. Without their guidance, many of these features would have been difficult to implement.

Regarding the communication data format between Emacs and Lsp-Copilot, I would like to especially thank [[https://github.com/blahgeek/emacs-lsp-booster][emacs-lsp-booster]]. The project integrates the implementation of emacs-lsp-booster, which encodes the JSON data returned to Emacs, further reducing the load on Emacs.
